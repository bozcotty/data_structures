# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Description
### Part 1 - Insertion Sort
My approach to the insertion sort algorithm initially began with me wanting to create a second 'sorted' array, separate from initial unsorted array. It seemed I would get about half way through my logic before getting stuck on iterating back through the array to compare all smaller numbers to the pointer. Eventually, I ended up whiteboarding a solution with Brook, that involved just sorting within the original array. I cleaned it up a bit and ended up with insert_sort.rb.

- #### Benchmark Tests on Insertion Sort (1..5000)
- Best case: .0063 s
- Worst case: 3.5112 s
- Random case: 1.8242 s

### Part 2 - Merge Sort ... TBD
